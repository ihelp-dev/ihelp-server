# OPTIONAL: VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB
  # If a container needs to access DynamoDB this allows a container in the private subnet
  # to talk to DynamoDB directly without needing to go via the NAT gateway. This reduces
  # the amount of bandwidth through the gateway, meaning that the gateway is free to serve
  # your other traffic.
